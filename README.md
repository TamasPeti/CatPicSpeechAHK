# 🐱 CatPicSpeechAHK 🐱

## 🎉 Description
Ever wanted to speak in cat pictures? Now you can! CatPicSpeechAHK is a small, fun script that lets you communicate using adorable cat images from cataas.com*. It's like talking in a secret, fluffy language that only cat lovers understand! 😺

<sup>*Only works on platforms that support image embeds from URLs. e.g.: Discord)</sup>

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Install the magical [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on your computer. It's like a wand for your PC! ✨
2. Save the script as a `.ahk` file (it's like the spellbook! 📖).
3. Run the script using AutoHotkey (time to cast the spell! 🧙‍♂️).
4. In any text field, type your message and press the Numpad Plus key. The script will select all text (like a cat catching a mouse! 🐭), copy it to the clipboard, and split it into words.
5. For each word, the script will send a URL for a cat picture with the word displayed on it. The color of the word will cycle through the colors of the rainbow (it's like a disco party for words! 🌈).

## ⚠️ Note
